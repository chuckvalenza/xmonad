Chuck Valenza's Xmonad Configuration

This repository was created so I could easily move my xmonad configuration from one computer to another, but is also up for public use.
Note that keybindings will have to be changed depending on device and user preference. This is constantly in development, and getting
better as I hone my skills, but is only maintained when I have the time.

Programs required:
dzen2
conky (if compiling from source, make sure to set mpd and imlib use flags)
