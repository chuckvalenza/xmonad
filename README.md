##Xmonad Configuration
======

When I used xmonad, I used this to move my confguration across installs and different machines. Now that I don't use xmonad as a window manager, this will lay here, dormant and unfinished, until Github starts limiting my space.

####Required:
dzen2
conky (if compiling from source, make sure to set mpd and imlib use flags)
